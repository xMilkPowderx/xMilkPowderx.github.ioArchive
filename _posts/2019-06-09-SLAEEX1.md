Student ID: SLAE - 1470

All code can be found in:

Assignment One: 
1. Creating Shellcode to Bind a Shell Over TCP
    - Binds to a port
    - Execs Shell on incoming connection
2. Port number should be easily configurable

In this assignment, we are going to create our own bind shell shellcode. To understand how this is going to work, we can take the one in msfvenom as example.

```
msfvenom -p linux/x86/shell_bind_tcp -f raw | sctest -vvv -Ss 10000
```
We will get a lot of output but the following part interests me
